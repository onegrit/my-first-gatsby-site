# Part 2: Use and Style React Components
## Introduction
In the previous part of the Tutorial, you started your first Gatsby site and used Gatsby Cloud to deploy it to the internet. Now that you have everything all set up, it’s time to make this site your own!

To build out the basic page structure for your blog site, you’ll need to know about React components and how Gatsby uses them.

By the end of this part of the Tutorial, you will be able to:

Create page components to add new pages to your site.
Import and use a pre-built component from another package.
Create your own reusable “building block” component.
Use component props to change the way a component renders.
Use the children prop to create a wrapper component.
