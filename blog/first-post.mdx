## Introduction
Now that you’ve set up your computer with all the tools you’ll need, it’s time to get started!

Over the course of this Tutorial, you’ll build and deploy your first Gatsby site: a blog site with support for images and MDX! (If that doesn’t mean anything to you now, that’s okay! It will by the time you reach the end.) Here’s a finished example of the site you’ll build. You can also follow along with the GitHub repository for the finished example.

In this part of the Tutorial, you will go through the process of creating the template for your blog site and deploying it online for everyone to see.

The diagram below shows a high-level view of how all the pieces of this process fit together. (Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense yet. You’ll learn about each step as you go.)
