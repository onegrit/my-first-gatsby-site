## Use and Style React Components
Key Gatsby Concept
  - Pages created in the src/pages directory use the name of the file as the route for the page.
  - 
### Use the <Link> component
The Gatsby Link component provides a performance feature called preloading. This means the resources for the linked page are requested when the link scrolls into view or when the mouse hovers on it. That way, when the user actually clicks on the link, the new page can load super quickly.
### Create a reusable layout component

### Style component with CSS Modules

## Part 3: Add Features with Plugins
### Add a plugin to your site
1. Install the plugin using npm
2. Configure the plugin in your site's gatsby-config.js
3. Use the Plugin features in your site, as needed.
